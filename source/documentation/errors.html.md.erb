#Errors

<p style="color:red">Note: All content in this page are work in progress and are evolving</p>

TGP APIs use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request succeeded or not.

They are usually in the range:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>SL #</th>
    <th>Range</th>
    <th>Scenario</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>200 to 299</td>
    <td>Request succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an API that needs to wait for further action</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>400 to 499</td>
    <td> Request failed because of a client error by your application</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>500 to 599</td>
    <td>Request failed because of an error on our server</td>
   </tr>
</table>

Errors specific to each API are shown in the Endpoints section, under Response. See our reference guide for more on errors.
